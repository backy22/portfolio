I set keywords which are \"successful,\" \"historic,\" \"elegant,\" \"formal\" and \"timeless.\" The biggest feature of my design is the layout of images. The layout that each piece of image finishes at a different point makes users scroll through the pages. Black, white, grey and gold match the keywords of the website. Keeping consistency in every page was the most difficult point of the project, because I tried to use various techniques to achieve the goal at first. I decided to focus on the four columns layout with randomness and removed some content which was not important. As a result, I kept consistency as well as achieved the goal of the website.
